## 💡 About The Project

BinGo is a web application designed to solve the inefficiencies in the current waste management ecosystem. It digitizes the process of scrap collection and recycling by connecting waste generators (households and industries) with collectors ("kabadiwalas") and recyclers.

The platform aims to:
* Bring transparency to scrap pricing.
* Increase the efficiency of waste collection.
* Provide a reliable source of materials for recyclers.
* Empower local collectors with digital tools to increase their income.
